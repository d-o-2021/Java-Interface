//why we Create default method in java interfaces?
for example : 

1.If we have a interface containing 10 abstract methods and if that interface is implements by multiple classes , but if we want to add new properties i.e methods 
to that interface we need to override that method's inside its all implmentation classes so to avoid such problem we can create default method inside an interface 
so that all class can get that method easily without changing anything in any class and we can override that default method accordingly based on the class requirment.

2.We can add new method to interface without adding or changing any properties inside the implementaion class.
